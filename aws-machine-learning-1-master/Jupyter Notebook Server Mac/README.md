### 3. You need to start your instance. Select your instance from the list (You can sort the list by Name) and click "Actions" -> "Instance State" -> "Start"
 - It might take a minute or two for your instance to "spin-up" (start)
 - If it seems like it is taking a long time for your Instance State to turn green, try refreshing the page

 ### 5.	We now need to modify the permissions of our private key (it can't be publicly viewable). To do this, highlight the first command ("chmod 400 your_key_name.pem") and open a terminal. Navigate to the location/directory on your machine where your private key is located, and run the command that you just copied.
  - To find the directory where your key is located, you can change directories with "cd directory_name"
 Â - You can then list files in the current directory with "ls"
