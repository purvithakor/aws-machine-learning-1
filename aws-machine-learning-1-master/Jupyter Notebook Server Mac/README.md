 ### 4.	We now need to modify the permissions of our private key (it can't be publicly viewable). To do this, highlight the first command ("chmod 400 your_key_name.pem") and open a terminal. Navigate to the location/directory on your machine where your private key is located, and run the command that you just copied.
  - To find the directory where your key is located, you can change directories with "cd directory_name"
 Â - You can then list files in the current directory with "ls"
